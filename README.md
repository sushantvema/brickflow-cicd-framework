# Developing a CI/CD Environment for Databricks Workflows via BrickFlow

## Philosophy

Developing a local CI/CD framework for Databricks deployments is crucial for
several important reasons:

### Cost Optimization

1. Reduced cloud compute costs: By developing and testing locally, you minimize
   the need for expensive cloud resources during the development phase.
2. Efficient resource utilization: Local development allows for better control
   over resource allocation, preventing unnecessary cluster spin-ups and idle
time.

### Consistency and Reliability

1. Environment parity: Local development environments can be configured to
   closely mimic production, ensuring consistency across stages.
2. Reproducible deployments: CI/CD pipelines automate the deployment process,
   reducing manual errors and ensuring consistent deployments across
environments.
3. Version control integration: Local development facilitates better integration
   with version control systems, improving code management and
collaboration.

### Enhanced Testing and Quality Assurance

1. Comprehensive test coverage: Local development enables thorough unit testing,
   integration testing, and end-to-end testing before deployment.
2. Early bug detection: Automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline helps identify
   issues early in the development cycle, reducing the cost of fixes.
3. Code quality checks: Local CI/CD frameworks can incorporate code quality
   analysis tools to maintain high standards and identify potential issues.

### Improved Collaboration and Productivity

1. Faster development cycles: Local development and automated CI/CD processes
   accelerate iteration and reduce time-to-market for ML models and data
pipelines.
2. Enhanced collaboration: Local frameworks facilitate better teamwork among
   data engineers, data scientists, and developers through shared processes and
tools.
3. Streamlined workflow: Automation of build, test, and deployment processes
   allows teams to focus on core development tasks rather than manual
operations.

### Scalability and Flexibility

1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Local CI/CD frameworks can incorporate IaC
   tools like Terraform, enabling scalable and reproducible infrastructure
management.
2. Adaptability to different environments: Local development allows for easy
   testing across various configurations and environments before production
deployment.

By implementing these CI/CD best practices locally for Databricks deployments,
organizations can significantly improve their data operations' efficiency,
reliability, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining high-quality standards
throughout the development lifecycle.

To set up a local development environment for Spark code that will be deployed
to Databricks using BrickFlow, we will follow these steps:

## Installation and Setup

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher on your local machine.

2. Install the Databricks CLI and configure it:

    ```bash
    pip install databricks-cli
    databricks configure -t
    ```

    This will set up your Databricks authentication.

3. Install BrickFlow:

    ```bash
    pip install brickflows
    ```

4. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    bf --help
    ```

## Project Configuration

1. Create a new BrickFlow project:

    ```bash
    bf projects add --name your_project_name
    ```

This will create a `brickflow-multi-project.yml` file and an `entrypoint.py` in
your workflows directory.
2. Configure your project in the `brickflow-multi-project.yml` file, specifying
   details like project name, deployment mode, and paths.

## Local Development

1. Write your Spark code in Python files within your project structure.
2. Use a helper function to create a SparkSession that works both locally and on
   Databricks. For example:

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    from delta import configure_spark_with_delta_pip

    def get_spark_session(): 
      builder = SparkSession.builder.config("spark.jars.packages",
                                  "io.delta:delta-core_2.12:1.0.0") 
      return configure_spark_with_delta_pip(builder).getOrCreate()

    spark = get_spark_session()
    ```

3. Use BrickFlow decorators to define your workflow tasks.
4. For local testing, create small test datasets that mimic your production data
   structure.

## Deployment Preparation

1. Use BrickFlow's CLI to synthesize your bundle:

    ```bash
    bf projects synth --project your_project_name --profile \
    your_databricks_profile 
    ```

    This will generate a `bundle.yml` file.
2. Validate your project configuration:

    ```bash
    bf projects synth --project your_project_name --profile \
    your_databricks_profile
    ```

## Deployment

When ready to deploy to Databricks:

1. Use the BrickFlow CLI:

    ```bash
    bf projects deploy --project your_project_name --profile \
    your_databricks_profile --env dev
    ```

2. For different environments or release candidates, use environment variables:

    ```bash
    BRICKFLOW_WORKFLOW_SUFFIX="0.1.0-rc1" bf projects deploy --project \
    your_project_name --profile your_databricks_profile --env test
    ```

    Remember to use version control (like Git) for your project and consider
    implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

    By following this setup, you can develop and test your Spark code locally, then
    seamlessly deploy it to Databricks using BrickFlow.
